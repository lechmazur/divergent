words_757.txt
The user wants a list of 25 words, each starting with "m".
These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 provided words.
I need to avoid proper nouns, brand names, place names, scientific names, cultural/historical names, institutional names, specific titles, and numerical identifiers.
The words must be single, standalone English words.
No two words should share any connection or fit into a specific category, including wordplay.
The output should be a numbered list of the 25 words.

Here's a possible approach:
1. Brainstorm a list of "m" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the restrictions.
3. Check for any connections or shared categories between the remaining words.
4. Refine the list until 25 unrelated words are found.1. magma
2. melon
3. mimic

6. myth
7. maple
