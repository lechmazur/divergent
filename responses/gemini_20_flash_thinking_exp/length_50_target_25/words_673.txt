The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "g". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 provided words. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "g" words.

Here's my plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "g" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the restrictions (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Check for any connections or shared categories between the remaining "g" words.
4. Ensure none of the "g" words are present in the user's list.
5. Select 25 unrelated "g" words.
6. Number the words from 1 to 25.1. gable
2. gadget
3. galaxy
4. gallon
5. gamble
6. gander
7. garland
8. garnet
9. gash
10. gasp
11. gather
12. gauge
13. gaunt
14. gauze
15. gavel
16. gazebo
17. gecko
18. gelatin
19. gemini
20. genesis
21. gentle
22. geode
23. germ
24. gesture
25. ghoul
