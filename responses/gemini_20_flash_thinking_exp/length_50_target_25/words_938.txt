The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "p". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "p" words themselves. This includes avoiding wordplay connections. I will go through the alphabet and think of "p" words, checking against the provided list and the other "p" words I've already selected to ensure no connections.

Plan:
1. Generate a list of "p" words.
2. Check each word against the provided list and the other generated "p" words for any connections or shared categories.
3. Ensure each word is a single, real English word.
4. Number the final 25 words.1. purple
