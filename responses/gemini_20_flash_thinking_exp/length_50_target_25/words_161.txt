words_161.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "l". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 provided words. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "l" words. I'll focus on common, everyday words to minimize overlap with the provided list and the forbidden categories.

Plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "l" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the restrictions (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Check for any semantic or categorical relationships between the remaining words.
4. Select 25 unrelated words.
5. Number the words 1-25.1. labor
2. ladder
3. ladybug
4. lagoon
5. lament
6. landscape
7. lantern
8. lapel
9. larva
10. lasso
11. lattice
12. laundry
13. lavish
14. lawyer
15. leaflet
16. legacy
17. legend
18. leisure
19. lemon
20. lentil
21. leopard
22. lever
23. lilac
24. limb
25. linen
