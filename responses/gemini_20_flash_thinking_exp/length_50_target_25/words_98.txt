words_98.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single, real English words, each starting with "s". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "s" words. I'll focus on diverse, common nouns and verbs to minimize overlap.

Here's my plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "s" words.
2. Filter out any words that might violate the restrictions (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Check for any obvious connections or shared categories between the remaining "s" words and the user's list.
4. Select 25 diverse "s" words that seem sufficiently unrelated.
5. Number the words 1-25.1. scarf
2. shadow
3. shelf
4. silk
5. silver
6. sing
7. skin
8. sky
9. sleep
10. slide
11. smell
12. smoke
13. snap
14. sock
15. soil
16. song
17. sound
18. soup
19. space
20. spark
21. spill
22. spoon
23. sprout
24. square
25. stairs
