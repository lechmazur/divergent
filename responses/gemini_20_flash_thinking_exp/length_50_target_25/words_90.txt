The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "s". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "s" words.

Here's my plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "s" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the given restrictions (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Check for any connections or shared categories between the remaining "s" words and the user's list.
4. Select 25 distinct and unrelated "s" words.
5. Number the words from 1 to 25.1. scarf
2. siren
3. sloth
4. sprint
5. saddle
6. solder
7. sponge
8. squid
9. stable
10. stalk
11. stanza
12. staple
13. stern
14. sting
15. stoop
16. strand
17. stripe
18. stump
19. suede
20. surge
21. swarm
22. swivel
23. swoop
24. syntax
25. system
