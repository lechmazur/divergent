words_252.txt
The user wants a list of 25 unique English words, each starting with "b", and unrelated to each other or the provided 50 words. I need to ensure no proper nouns, specific identifiers, or connections between the "b" words themselves.

Here's my plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "b" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the user's restrictions (proper nouns, connections to provided words, or connections to each other).
3. Select the first 25 valid words.
4. Format the output as a numbered list.1. badger
2. baffle
3. ballast
4. bamboo
5. bandage
6. banter
7. barnacle
8. barren
9. bastion
10. baton
11. bauble
12. bazaar
13. beacon
14. bead
15. beagle
16. beaker
17. beam
18. beast
19. beetle
20. bellow
21. bellow
22. bewilder
23. bias
24. biceps
25. biscuit
