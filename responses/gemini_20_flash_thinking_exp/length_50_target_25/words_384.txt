words_384.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single, real English words, each starting with "r". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 provided words. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "r" words. I'll focus on diverse, common nouns and verbs to minimize overlap.

Here's a possible plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "r" words.
2. Filter out any words that are proper nouns or specific identifiers based on the user's criteria.
3. Check for any obvious connections or shared categories between the remaining "r" words and the provided list.
4. Select 25 distinct "r" words with minimal semantic overlap.1. rabbit
2. radio
3. raft
4. rage
5. rail
6. rain
7. raise
8. rake
9. rally
10. ram
11. ranch
12. range
13. rank
14. rapid
15. rare
16. rash
17. rat
18. rate
19. ratio
20. raven
21. raw
