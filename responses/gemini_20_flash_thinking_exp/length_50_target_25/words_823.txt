words_823.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single, real English words, each starting with 'v', 'x', 'z', 'j', or 'q'. These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, brand names, place names, scientific names, cultural/historical names, institutional names, specific titles, and numerical identifiers. The words also cannot share any connections or fit into a specific category, including wordplay connections. I need to number the words from 1 to 25.

Here's a possible plan:
1. Go through each allowed starting letter ('v', 'x', 'z', 'j', 'q') and brainstorm words.
2. For each brainstormed word, check if it violates any of the exclusion rules.
3. Compare each potential word against the user's provided list and other potential words to ensure no connections or shared categories exist.
4. Number the final 25 words.1. vex
