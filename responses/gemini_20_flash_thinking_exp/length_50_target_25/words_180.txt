The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "k". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 provided words. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "k" words.

Here's a possible approach:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "k" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the restrictions (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Check for any obvious connections or shared categories between the remaining "k" words.
4. Compare the "k" words against the provided list to ensure no repetitions or connections.
