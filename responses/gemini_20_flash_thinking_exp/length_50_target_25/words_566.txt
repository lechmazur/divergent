words_566.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single, real English words, each starting with 'v', 'x', 'z', 'j', or 'q'. These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 provided words. No proper nouns or specific identifiers are allowed. No two words in the final list of 25 should share any connection, category, or wordplay relationship. The output should be a numbered list of just the words.

Plan:
1. Iterate through possible words starting with 'v', 'x', 'z', 'j', or 'q'.
2. For each potential word, check if it's a real English word.
3. Check if the word is present in the user's provided list.
4. Check if the word is a proper noun or specific identifier.
5. Check if the word has any connection (semantic, categorical, or wordplay) with any of the words already selected for the 25-word list.
6. If all checks pass, add the word to the 25-word list.
7. Repeat until 25 words are collected.
8. Format the output as a numbered list.1. vortex
2. xylem
3. zenith

5. quartz
