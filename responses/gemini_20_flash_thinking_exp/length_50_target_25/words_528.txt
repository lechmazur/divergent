The user wants a list of 25 unique English words, each starting with "y", and unrelated to each other or the provided 50 words. I need to be careful to avoid any proper nouns, specific identifiers, or connections between the words, even through wordplay.

Here's my plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "y" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the proper noun/identifier rules.
3. Check for any semantic or categorical relationships between the remaining words.
4. Ensure no wordplay connections exist (palindromes, homophones, etc.).
5. Select 25 words that meet all criteria and are also distinct from the provided list.1. yacht
2. yarn
3. yawl
4. yeast
5. yelp
6. yonder
7. yolk
8. yore
9. young
10. yours
11. youth
12. yummy
13. yarrow
14. yearly
15. yearn
16. yester
17. yield
18. yikes
19. yodel
20. yogi
21. yowl
22. yuppie
