words_1.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "g". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "g" words. I'll focus on common, everyday words starting with "g" and ensure they don't have obvious semantic or phonetic links.

Here's a possible strategy:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "g" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the restrictions (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Check for semantic connections between the remaining words.
4. Check for phonetic connections (homophones, near rhymes).
5. Select 25 words that are sufficiently distinct.1. gable
2. gadget
3. galaxy
4. gallon
5. gamble
6. garment
7. gash
8. gasp
9. gather
10. gauge
11. gavel
12. gaze
13. gear
14. gecko
15. gelatin
16. gem
17. gender
18. general
19. gentle
20. genuine
21. germ
22. gesture
23. ghastly
24. ghost
25. giant
