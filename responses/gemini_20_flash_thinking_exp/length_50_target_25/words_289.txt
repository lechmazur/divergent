words_289.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single, real English words, each starting with 'v', 'x', 'z', 'j', or 'q'. These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 provided words. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the 25 words. I'll focus on selecting simple, common nouns and verbs to minimize the risk of overlap or categorization.

Plan:
1. Create a pool of words starting with 'v', 'x', 'z', 'j', or 'q'.
2. Check each potential word against the 50 provided words.
3. Ensure no two selected words share a category or connection.
4. Number the final 25 words.1. vacuum
2. xylem
3. zero
4. jabber
5. quartz
6. vault
7. xenon
8. zinc
9. jester
10. quiver
11. vortex
12. xerophyte
13. zigzag
14. javelin
