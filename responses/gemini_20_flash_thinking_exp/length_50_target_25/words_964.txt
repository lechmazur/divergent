The user wants a list of 25 unique English words, each starting with "y", and unrelated to each other or the provided 50 words. I need to ensure no two "y" words share any obvious or subtle connection, including wordplay. I also need to avoid all forms of proper nouns and specific identifiers. The output should be a numbered list only.

Here's my plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "y" words.
2. Filter out any proper nouns or specific identifiers.
3. Check for any relationships or connections between the remaining "y" words and the provided list.
4. Check for any relationships or connections between the remaining "y" words themselves, including wordplay.
5. Select 25 unrelated "y" words.
6. Format the output as a numbered list.1. yacht
2. yarn
3. yawn
4. yeast
5. yelp
6. yield
7. yikes
8. yodel
9. yoga
10. yolk
11. yore
12. young
13. yours
14. youth
15. yummy
16. yucca
17. yuppie
18. yurt
