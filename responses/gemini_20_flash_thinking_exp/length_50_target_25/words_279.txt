The user wants a list of 25 unique English words, each starting with "i", and unrelated to each other or the provided list of 50 words. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "i" words.

Here's my plan:
1. **Brainstorm "i" words:** I'll start by generating a large pool of words beginning with "i".
2. **Filter for uniqueness:** I'll compare each new "i" word against the provided list and my growing list to ensure no repetitions.
3. **Check for forbidden categories:** I'll carefully review each potential word to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any obvious connections or shared categories. This will be the most challenging part. I need to think broadly about potential connections, even subtle ones.
4. **Iterate and refine:** If I find connections or run out of unrelated words, I'll go back to brainstorming and filtering.
5. **Number the final list:** Once I have 25 valid words, I'll number them 1 through 25.1. ignite
