words_2.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "i", and unrelated to each other or the provided 50 words. I need to ensure no two words share a category, connection, or even a wordplay relationship. I also need to avoid all forms of proper nouns and specific identifiers. The output should be a numbered list only.

Here's my plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "i" words.
2. Filter out any proper nouns or specific identifiers.
3. Check for relationships and categories between the brainstormed words and the user's provided list.
4. Select 25 words that are sufficiently unrelated.
5. Number the selected words.1. ignite
2. image
3. impact
4. index
5. infant
6. inform
7. ingest
8. inhale
9. inland
10. inner
11. input
12. insect
13. insist
14. intact
15. intend
16. intern
17. invade
18. invert
19. iodine
20. irate
21. irk
22. irony
23. italic
24. item
25. ivory
