words_939.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "r". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 provided words. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "r" words. I'll focus on selecting diverse and common "r" words that don't easily fall into thematic groups.

Plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "r" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the restrictions (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Check for any connections or shared categories between the remaining "r" words and the provided list.
4. Select 25 distinct and unrelated "r" words.
5. Number the words from 1 to 25.1. rabbit
2. radish
3. raft
4. rage
5. rail
6. rain
7. raise
8. rake
9. rally
10. ram
11. ranch
12. range
13. rank
14. rapid
15. rare
16. rasp
17. rat
18. rate
19. ratio
20. raven
21. raw
22. rayon
23. razor
24. reach
25. react
