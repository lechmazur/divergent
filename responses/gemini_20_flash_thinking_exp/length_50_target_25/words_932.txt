The user wants a list of 25 unique English words, each starting with "i", and unrelated to each other or the 50 provided words. I need to be careful to avoid any proper nouns, specific identifiers, or words that share a category or connection.

Here's my plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "i" words.
2. Filter out any words that are proper nouns or specific identifiers based on the user's detailed instructions.
3. Check for any connections or shared categories between the brainstormed "i" words and the user's provided list.
4. Select 25 unique "i" words that have no apparent connection to each other or the provided list.
5. Number the selected words from 1 to 25.1. ignite
2. image
3. impact
4. imply
5. indoor
6. infant
7. inform
8. ingest
9. inland
10. insect
11. insist
12. intact
13. intend
14. intern
15. invent
16. invert
17. invoke
18. inward
19. iodine
20. irate
21. iris
22. irony
23. italic
24. itchy
25. ivory
