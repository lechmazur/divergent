The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "g". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 provided words. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "g" words.

Here's my plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "g" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the restrictions (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Check for any obvious connections or shared categories between the remaining "g" words.
4. Compare the "g" words against the provided list to ensure no repetitions.
5. Select 25 unrelated "g" words.
6. Number the selected words from 1 to 25.1. galaxy
2. garment
3. gasp
4. gather
5. gauge
6. gaze
7. gear
8. gecko
9. gem
10. gender
11. gentle
12. genuine
13. germ
14. gesture
15. ghost
16. giant
17. giggle
18. ginger
19. girdle
20. glacier
21. glance
22. glare
23. gleam
24. glide
25. glimpse
