words_186.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "r". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "r" words. I'll focus on diverse, common nouns and verbs to minimize overlap.

Plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "r" words.
2. Filter out any words that might violate the restrictions (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Check for any obvious connections or shared categories between the remaining "r" words and the user's list.
4. Select 25 words that are as distinct as possible.
5. Number the words 1-25.1. rabbit
2. radio
3. raft
4. rage
5. rail
6. rain
7. raise
8. rake
9. rally
10. ram
11. ranch
12. range
13. rank
14. rapid
15. rare
16. rash
17. rat
18. rate
19. ratio
20. raw
21. rayon
22. razor
23. reach
24. react
25. read
