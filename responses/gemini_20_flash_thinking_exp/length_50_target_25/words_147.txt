words_147.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "s". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the words. I will focus on common nouns and adjectives, ensuring no obvious links exist.

Here's my plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "s" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the user's constraints (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Check for any obvious connections or shared categories between the remaining words.
4. Select 25 words that meet all criteria.
5. Number the words from 1 to 25.1. shade
2. swift
3. solid
4. siren
5. sleeve
6. sandal
7. scarf
8. saddle
9. saucer
10. scale
11. scent
12. scope
13. scrub
14. serum
15. shovel
16. signal
17. simmer
18. sketch
19. skillet
20. slumber
21. smudge
22. socket
23. solace
24. solvent
25. sprout
