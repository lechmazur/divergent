The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "g", and unrelated to each other or the 50 provided words. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "g" words.

Here's my plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "g" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the restrictions (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Check for any connections or shared categories between the remaining "g" words and the provided list.
4. Select 25 "g" words that are distinct and unrelated.1. gable
2. gadget
3. galaxy
4. gallon
5. gamble
6. garment
7. gash
8. gasp
9. gather
10. gauge
11. gaunt
12. gavel
13. gaze
14. gear
15. gecko
16. gelatin
17. gemini
18. gender
