words_750.txt
The user wants a list of 25 English words, each starting with "e". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "e" words. I will go through the alphabet and think of "e" words, checking against the provided list and the other "e" words I've already selected to ensure no connections.
