words_374.txt
The user wants a list of 25 English words, each starting with "e". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the new words. I will go through the alphabet and think of "e" words, checking against the provided list and the other constraints.

1. **embark** - Seems safe.
2. **eject** -  No obvious connection to embark.
3. **elbow** -  Unrelated.
4. **elder** -  Unrelated.
5. **elope** -  Unrelated.
6. **email** -  Unrelated.
7. **ember** -  Unrelated.
8. **emblem** - Unrelated.
9. **embody** - Unrelated.
10. **emerge** - Unrelated.
11. **emit** - Unrelated.
12. **empire** -  Could be slightly related to 'song dynasty' or 'astrakhan khanate' but it's a general term. I'll keep it for now but be mindful.
13. **employ** - Unrelated.
14. **empty** - Unrelated.
15. **enable** - Unrelated.
16. **enact** - Unrelated.
17. **enamel** - Unrelated.

22. **enlist** - Unrelated.
23. **enough** - Unrelated.
24. **ensue** - Unrelated.
25. **entice** - Unrelated.
