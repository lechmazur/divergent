words_789.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single, real English words, each starting with "c". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "c" words. I'll focus on diverse, common nouns and adjectives to minimize overlap.

Here's a possible plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "c" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the restrictions (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Check for any obvious connections or shared categories between the remaining words.
4. Select 25 words that are sufficiently distinct.1. cabin
2. cactus
3. cadence
4. cage
5. calamity
6. caliber
7. callous
8. canal
9. candid
10. canopy
11. canyon
12. capable
13. captive
14. carcass
15. cargo
16. carol
17. cascade
18. casket
19. casting
20. casual
21. cavern
22. cease
23. cellar
24. census
25. ceramic
