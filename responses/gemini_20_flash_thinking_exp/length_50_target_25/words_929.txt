words_929.txt
The user wants a list of 25 English words, each starting with "e". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to be careful to avoid any proper nouns, specific identifiers, or words that share a category or connection. I'll focus on concrete nouns, abstract nouns, verbs, and adjectives to ensure diversity and avoid connections.

Here's my plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "e" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the user's restrictions (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Check for any obvious connections or shared categories between the brainstormed words and the user's list.
4. Select 25 words that are as unrelated as possible.1. each
