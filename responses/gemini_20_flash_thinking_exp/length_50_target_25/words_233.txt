words_233.txt
The user wants a list of 25 unique English words, each starting with "c", and unrelated to each other or the provided list of 50 words. I need to ensure no proper nouns or specific identifiers are used. The words should not share any obvious or subtle connections, including wordplay. The output should be a numbered list of just the words.

Here's my plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "c" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the restrictions (proper nouns, connections to the provided list, or connections between the brainstormed words).
3. Select 25 distinct and unrelated words from the filtered list.
4. Format the output as a numbered list.1. cabin
2. cactus
3. cadence
4. calcium
5. caliber
6. callous
7. camphor
8. canvas
9. canyon
10. capable
11. caption
12. carcass
13. cardinal
14. cargo
15. carol
16. cascade
17. casket
18. cassava
19. castor
20. catalog
21. catapult
22. cataract
23. cavern
24. cavity
25. celery
