The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "r". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 provided words. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the new words. I'll focus on common, everyday words starting with "r" and double-check against the provided list and for any obvious connections.

Plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "r" words.
2. Filter out any proper nouns or specific identifiers.
3. Check each remaining word against the provided list.
4. Ensure no two selected "r" words share a category or connection.
5. Number the final 25 words.1. rabbit
2. radio
3. raft
4. rage
5. rail
6. rain
7. rake
8. rally
9. ram
10. ranch
11. range
