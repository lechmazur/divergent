words_790.txt
The user wants a list of 25 English words, each starting with "e". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "e" words. This includes avoiding wordplay connections. The output should be a numbered list of just the words.

Here's a possible plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "e" words.
2. Filter out any words that are proper nouns or specific identifiers based on the user's criteria.
3. Check for any obvious connections or shared categories between the remaining words.
4. Select 25 words that appear to be sufficiently unrelated.
5. Double-check against the user's provided list to ensure no overlap.
6. Format the output as a numbered list.1. elbow
2. emerald
3. erupt
4. easel
5. echo
6. edible
7. effort
8. eject
9. elapse
10. elect
11. eleven
12. embark
13. employ
14. empty
15. enable
16. endure
17. engulf
18. enlarge
