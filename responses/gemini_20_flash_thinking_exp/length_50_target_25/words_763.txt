The user wants a list of 25 unique English words, each starting with "u", and unrelated to each other or the 50 provided words. I need to be careful to avoid any proper nouns, specific identifiers, or connections between the "u" words themselves. I'll go through the alphabet and think of "u" words, checking against the provided list and for any potential connections between the "u" words as I go.

Draft 1:
1. upon
2. under
3. utter
4. usual
5. urban
6. ugly
7. ulcer
8. umpire
9. undo
10. unify
11. unison
12. unit
13. unite
14. unless
15. unlock
16. unload
17. uproar
18. upset
19. urge
20. urn
21. usurp
22. utility
23. utilize
24. utmost
25. ultraviolet

Critique 1: This is a good start, but some words have semantic connections (unify, unison, unit, unite). Also, some words are quite common and might have indirect associations.
