The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "g", and unrelated to each other or the 50 provided words. I need to ensure no proper nouns or specific identifiers are used. The words should also not share any obvious connections or fit into a specific category, including wordplay connections.

Here's my plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "g" words.
2. Filter out any words that are proper nouns or specific identifiers based on the provided rules.
3. Check for any obvious connections or shared categories between the brainstormed words.
4. Compare the brainstormed words against the provided list of 50 words to avoid repetition.
5. Select 25 words that meet all the criteria.
6. Number the selected words from 1 to 25.1. galaxy
2. garment
3. gaseous
4. gelatin
5. gemini
6. general
7. genetic
8. genuine
9. geology
10. geometry
11. geriatric
12. germane
13. gestate
14. ghastly
15. gigantic
16. giggle
