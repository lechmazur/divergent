words_136.txt
The user wants a list of 25 English words, each starting with "e". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "e" words. I'll focus on concrete nouns, verbs, and adjectives to minimize overlap. I'll keep track of the 50 provided words to ensure no repetition.

Plan:
1. Generate a diverse set of "e" words.
2. Check each "e" word against the provided list and the other generated "e" words for any connections or shared categories.
3. Ensure each word is a single, real English word.
4. Number the final 25 words.1. earthworm
2. ebony
3. eclipse
4. ecology
5. edifice
6. educate
7. eel

9. egress
10. eject
