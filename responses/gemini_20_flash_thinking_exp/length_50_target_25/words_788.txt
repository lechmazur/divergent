The user wants a list of 25 unique English words, each starting with the letter "b". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 provided words. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the 'b' words.

Here's a plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of 'b' words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the exclusion rules (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Check for any obvious connections or shared categories between the remaining 'b' words.
4. Select 25 words that are sufficiently distinct and unrelated.
5. Number the selected words from 1 to 25.1. bellow
2. brittle
3. blunder
4. buoyant
5. barren
6. bewilder
7. blemish
8. bolster
9. bramble
10. brazen
11. brevity
