The user wants a list of 25 unique English words, each starting with "i", and unrelated to each other or the provided 50 words. I need to be careful to avoid any proper nouns, specific identifiers, or words that share a category or connection.

Here's my plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "i" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the proper noun/identifier rules.
3. Check each remaining word against the user's provided list to ensure no duplicates.
4. Evaluate the remaining words for any thematic connections or shared categories. This will be the most challenging part. I'll need to think broadly about potential connections, including literal meanings, wordplay, and conceptual links.
5. Select 25 words that pass all the checks.
6. Number the words from 1 to 25.1. ignite
2. image
3. impact
4. imply
5. indoor
6. infer
7. ingot
8. inland
9. input
10. insect
11. inside
12. insist
13. intact
14. intent
15. ivory
16. italic
17. item
18. itself
19. idiom
20. iris
21. island
22. issue
23. icing
24. infant
25. indigo
