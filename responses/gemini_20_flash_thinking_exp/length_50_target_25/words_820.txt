The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "s". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "s" words.

Here's a plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "s" words.
2. Filter out any words that are proper nouns or specific identifiers based on the user's criteria.
3. Check for any obvious connections or shared categories between the remaining words.
4. Select 25 words that are sufficiently unrelated.
5. Number the words from 1 to 25.1. saber
2. saddle
3. saffron
4. sage
5. salad
6. salmon
7. saloon
8. salsa
9. salt
10. sample
11. sand
12. sandal
13. sap
14. sardine
15. sash
16. satin
17. saucer
18. sausage
19. savage
20. saw
21. scale
22. scarf
23. scene
24. scent
25. scoop
