words_295.txt
The user wants a list of 25 English words, each starting with "e". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "e" words. I'll focus on concrete nouns, abstract nouns, verbs, and adjectives to ensure diversity and lack of connection. I'll also need to carefully check against the provided list to avoid any overlap.

Here's a possible plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "e" words.
2. Filter out any proper nouns or specific identifiers.
3. Check each remaining word against the user's provided list.
4. Evaluate the remaining words for any connections or shared categories.
5. Select 25 unrelated words.
6. Number the words from 1 to 25.1. each
