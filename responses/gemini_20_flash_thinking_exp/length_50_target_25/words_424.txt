The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "s". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "s" words. I will go through the alphabet and think of "s" words, checking against the provided list and the other "s" words I've already chosen to ensure no connections.

1. Start with simple, common "s" words.
2. Consider different parts of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs).
3. Think about abstract concepts and concrete objects.
