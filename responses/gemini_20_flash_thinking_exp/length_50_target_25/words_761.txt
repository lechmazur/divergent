The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "s". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "s" words. I'll focus on common, everyday nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs to minimize overlap. I'll keep track of the words I've chosen to ensure no repetitions.1. scarf
