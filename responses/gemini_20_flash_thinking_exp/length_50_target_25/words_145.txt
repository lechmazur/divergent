The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "p". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "p" words.

Here's a possible plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "p" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the restrictions (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Check for any connections or shared categories between the remaining "p" words and the user's list.
4. Select 25 distinct and unrelated "p" words.
5. Number the words from 1 to 25.1. purple
2. puzzle
3. prism
4. pylon
5. pantry
6. parchment
7. pasture
8. pebble
9. perfume
10. petal
11. phantom
12. pigment
13. pillow
14. pirate
15. piston
16. planet
17. plaster
18. plateau
19. pliers
20. pollen
21. portal
22. postage
