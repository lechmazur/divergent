The user wants a list of 25 unique English words, each starting with "i", and unrelated to each other or the provided 50 words. I need to ensure no two words share a category, connection, or even wordplay. I also need to avoid all forms of proper nouns and specific identifiers. The output should be a numbered list only.

Here's my plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "i" words.
2. Filter out any proper nouns or specific identifiers.
3. Check for relationships or shared categories between the brainstormed words and the user's provided list.
4. Select 25 words that are distinct and unrelated.
5. Number the selected words.1. ignite
2. image
3. impact
4. imply
5. indoor
6. infant
7. inform
8. ingest
9. inhale
10. inland
11. inner
12. input
13. insect
14. inside
15. insist
16. intact
17. intend
18. intern
19. invent
20. invert
21. invoke
22. inward
23. iodine
24. italic
25. item
