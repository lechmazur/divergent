words_17.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single, real English words, each starting with 'v', 'x', 'z', 'j', or 'q'. These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the 25 words. I'll go through each allowed starting letter and brainstorm words, checking for any potential connections or overlaps.

v: void, vault, verge, vex, vigor
x: xylem, xenon,  xerophyte,  xiphoid
z: zenith,  zephyr,  zygote,  zinc
j:  jolt,  jinx,  jade,  jester
q:  quill,  query,  quota,  quaver

I'll try to select words from these brainstormed lists that seem the most distinct and unrelated.1. void

5. quill
6. vault
7. xenon
8. zephyr
