words_76.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "p". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 provided words. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "p" words themselves. This includes avoiding wordplay connections. The output should be a numbered list of just the 25 words.

Here's a possible plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "p" words.
2. Filter out any words that are proper nouns or specific identifiers based on the provided rules.
3. Check the remaining words against the user's list to ensure no repetitions.
4. Carefully review the remaining words to eliminate any that have obvious connections or fit into the same category. This will be the most challenging step.
5. Number the final 25 words.1. purple
