The user wants a list of 25 single, real English words, each starting with "i", and unrelated to each other or the provided 50 words. I need to ensure no two words share any connection, category, or wordplay element. I also need to avoid all forms of proper nouns and specific identifiers. The output should be a numbered list only.

Here's my plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "i" words.
2. Filter out any words that are proper nouns or specific identifiers.
3. Check for any obvious connections or categories among the remaining words.
4. Carefully examine pairs of words for subtle connections, including wordplay.
5. Select 25 words that meet all the criteria.
6. Number the words and format the output.1. ignite
2. image
3. impact
4. imply
5. indoor
6. infer
7. ingot
8. inland
9. input
10. insect
11. inside
12. insist
13. intact
14. intent
15. inter
16. ionic
17. irate
18. irony
19. italic
20. itchy
21. ivory
22. idiom
23. ideal
24. index
25. item
