The user wants a list of 25 unique English words, each starting with "o", and unrelated to each other or the provided list of 50 words. I need to ensure no proper nouns or specific identifiers are used. The words should also not share any obvious connections or fit into a specific category, including wordplay connections.

Here's my plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "o" words.
2. Filter out any words that are proper nouns or specific identifiers based on the user's criteria.
3. Check for any obvious connections or shared categories between the remaining words.
4. Select 25 words that meet all the criteria and are also distinct from the user's provided list.
5. Number the selected words from 1 to 25.1. oasis
2. oblong
3. octave
4. odor
5. ogre
6. omen
7. omit
8. onion
9. onyx
10. ooze
11. opal
12. opera
13. optic
14. orbit
15. organ
16. oriole
17. ornate
18. otter
19. ounce
20. outer
21. outlay
22. oval
23. ovary
24. overt
25. oxide
