words_407.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single, real English words, each starting with 'v', 'x', 'z', 'j', or 'q'. These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 provided words. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the 25 words. I'll focus on selecting words with distinct meanings and avoid any obvious semantic or phonetic relationships.

Plan:
1. Iterate through the allowed starting letters ('v', 'x', 'z', 'j', 'q').
2. For each letter, brainstorm words, ensuring they are real English words and not in the provided list.
3. Check each potential word against the existing list of 25 (as I build it) and the 50 provided words to ensure no repetition.
4. Critically evaluate each new word to ensure it doesn't share a category or connection with any other word in the growing list. This will be the most challenging part. I'll consider semantic relationships, homophones, and even potential wordplay connections.
