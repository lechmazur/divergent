The user wants a list of 25 unique English words, each starting with "y", and unrelated to each other or the provided 50 words. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "y" words themselves.

Here's my plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "y" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the proper noun/identifier rules.
3. Check for any semantic or categorical relationships between the remaining "y" words.
4. Ensure none of the "y" words are present in the user's provided list.
5. Select 25 distinct and unrelated "y" words.
6. Format the output as a numbered list.1. yacht
2. yarn
3. yawn
4. yeast
5. yelp
6. yonder
7. youth
8. yummy
9. yucca
10. yikes
11. yield
12. yowl
13. yuppie
14. yarrow
15. yttrium
16. yakuza
17. yarmulke
18. yesteryear
19. yokel
20. yttria
