words_4.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "l". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 provided words. I need to be careful to avoid any proper nouns, specific identifiers, or connections between the words, even through wordplay.

Here's my plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "l" words.
2. Filter out any words that are proper nouns or specific identifiers based on the user's detailed instructions.
3. Check for any obvious connections or shared categories between the remaining words.
4. Carefully examine for less obvious connections, including wordplay, homophones, or related concepts.
5. Select 25 words that are sufficiently distinct and unrelated.
6. Number the words from 1 to 25.1. lagoon
2. lament
3. lance
4. lantern
5. lapel
6. larynx
7. latent
8. lattice
9. laudable
10. lavish
11. lax
12. leaflet
13. legacy
14. legible
15. lenient
16. lexicon
17. liaison
18. ligament
19. lilac
20. limber
21. lintel
22. livid
23. loath
24. locale
25. lucid
