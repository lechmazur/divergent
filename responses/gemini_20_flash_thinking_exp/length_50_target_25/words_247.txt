words_247.txt
The user wants a list of 25 unique English words, each starting with "t", and unrelated to each other or the provided 50 words. I need to be careful to avoid any proper nouns, specific identifiers, or connections between the "t" words themselves. I'll focus on common nouns, verbs, and adjectives, ensuring no obvious semantic or categorical links.

Here's a possible strategy:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "t" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the exclusion rules (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Check for relationships between the remaining "t" words and the provided list.
4. Check for relationships among the remaining "t" words themselves (semantic, categorical, wordplay).
5. Select 25 words that meet all criteria.1. table
