words_696.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "k". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 provided words. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "k" words themselves. I'll focus on common nouns and adjectives, ensuring no obvious links in meaning or wordplay.

Plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "k" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the restrictions (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Check for any semantic or wordplay connections between the remaining "k" words.
4. Select 25 unrelated words.
5. Number the words 1-25.1. kale
2. kayak
3. keel
4. kernel
5. kettle
6. khaki
7. kidney
8. kiosk
9. kismet
10. kith
11. kiwi
12. knack
13. knave
14. knead
15. knelt
16. knife
17. knob
18. knot
19. koala
20. kudos
21. kraft
22. kraken
23. krona
24. krypton
25. kumquat
