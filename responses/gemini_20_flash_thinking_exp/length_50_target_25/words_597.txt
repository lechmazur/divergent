The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "k", and unrelated to each other or the 50 provided words. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "k" words themselves. This includes avoiding wordplay connections. I will generate a diverse set of "k" words, focusing on different parts of speech and abstract/concrete concepts to minimize overlap.1. kale
