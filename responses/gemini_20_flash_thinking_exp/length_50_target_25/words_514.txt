words_514.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single, real English words, each starting with "g". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "g" words.

Here's a plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "g" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the restrictions (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Carefully select 25 words from the remaining pool, ensuring no obvious or subtle connections exist between them. I'll need to consider semantic relationships, potential categories, and even wordplay.
4. Number the selected words from 1 to 25.1. gable
2. gadget
3. galaxy
4. gallon
5. gamble
6. garment
7. gash
8. gasp
9. gather
10. gauge
11. gavel
12. gaze
13. gear
14. gecko
15. gelatin
16. gemini
17. gender
18. gentle
19. germ
20. ghost
21. giant
22. giggle
23. ginger
24. girdle
25. glitch
