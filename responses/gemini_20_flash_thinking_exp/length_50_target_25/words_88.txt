words_88.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single, real English words, each starting with "r". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 provided words. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "r" words themselves. I'll focus on diverse, common nouns and verbs to minimize overlap.

Plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "r" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the restrictions (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Check for any semantic or categorical relationships between the remaining "r" words.
4. Ensure none of the "r" words are present in the user's provided list.
5. Select 25 unrelated "r" words.
6. Format the output as a numbered list.1. rabbit
2. radio
3. raft
4. rage
5. rail
6. rain
7. rake
8. rally
9. ram
10. ranch
11. range
12. rank
13. rapid
14. rare
15. rash
16. rat
17. rate
18. ratio
19. raw
20. ray
21. razor
22. reach
23. react
24. read
25. real
