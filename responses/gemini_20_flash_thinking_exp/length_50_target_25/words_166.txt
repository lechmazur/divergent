words_166.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "r", and unrelated to each other or the provided 50 words. I need to ensure no two words share a category, connection, or even wordplay elements. I also need to avoid all forms of proper nouns and specific identifiers. The output should be a numbered list only.

Here's my plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "r" words.
2. Filter out any proper nouns or specific identifiers.
3. Check for any obvious connections or shared categories between the brainstormed words.
4. Carefully select 25 words, ensuring no two have any discernible relationship, including wordplay.
5. Number the selected words from 1 to 25.
6. Double-check against the user's provided list to avoid repetition.1. rabbit
