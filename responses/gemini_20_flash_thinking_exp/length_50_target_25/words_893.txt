The user wants a list of 25 unique English words, each starting with "i", and unrelated to each other or the provided 50 words. I need to ensure no proper nouns or specific identifiers are used. The words should also not share any conceptual connections or fit into the same category, including wordplay connections. I will go through potential "i" words and check them against the provided list and the no-connection rule.

Draft 1:
1. idea
2. ignite
3. image
4. impact
5. imply
6. index
7. indoor
8. infer
9. ingot
10. injure
11. inland
12. input
13. insect
14. inside
15. insist
16. instant
17. intact
18. intend
19. intern
20. item
21. ivory
22. italic
23. itchy
24. iris
25. island

Critique 1: Several of these words have conceptual connections. For example, "ignite" and "impact" could be related. "Indoor" and "inland" relate to location. "Insect" is a type of item. "Intact" and "inside" have a spatial relationship. "Iris" is a part of the body, which could be considered a category.
