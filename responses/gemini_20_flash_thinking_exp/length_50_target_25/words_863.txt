words_863.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single, real English words, each starting with 'v', 'x', 'z', 'j', or 'q'. These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the 25 words. I'll focus on selecting words from diverse semantic fields to ensure no overlap.

Plan:
1. Create a pool of words starting with 'v', 'x', 'z', 'j', or 'q'.
2. Check each word against the user's provided list and the exclusion criteria.
3. Ensure no two selected words share a category or connection.
4. Number the final 25 words.1. vex
