The user wants a list of 25 unique English words, each starting with "y", and unrelated to each other or the provided 50 words. I need to be careful to avoid any connections between the "y" words themselves and also between the "y" words and the provided list. I also need to strictly adhere to the exclusion criteria for proper nouns and specific identifiers. I will focus on common, everyday words to minimize the chance of overlap or connection.

Here's a possible strategy:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "y" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the exclusion criteria.
3. Check for any semantic or categorical relationships between the remaining "y" words.
4. Check for any relationships between the "y" words and the provided list.
5. Select 25 words that meet all the requirements.1. yacht
