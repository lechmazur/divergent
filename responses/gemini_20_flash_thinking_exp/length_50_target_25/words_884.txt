The user wants a list of 25 unique English words, each starting with "w". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 provided words. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "w" words. I'll focus on common, everyday words that start with "w" and ensure they don't fall into any of the forbidden categories or relate to the provided list.

1. Brainstorm a large pool of "w" words.
2. Filter out any words that are proper nouns or specific identifiers.
3. Check for any connections or shared categories between the remaining "w" words and the provided list.
4. Select 25 unique and unrelated "w" words.
