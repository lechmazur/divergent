The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "i". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "i" words. I'll focus on common, everyday words starting with "i" and double-check for any potential connections to the provided list.

Here's a possible plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "i" words.
2. Filter out any proper nouns or specific identifiers.
3. Check each remaining word against the user's list for direct matches or close synonyms.
4. Evaluate the remaining words for any thematic connections or shared categories.
5. Select 25 words that meet all the criteria.1. ignite
2. image
3. impact
