The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "p". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to be careful to avoid any proper nouns, specific identifiers, and connections between the words, even through wordplay or shared categories.

Here's my plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "p" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the exclusion rules (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Check for any obvious connections or shared categories between the brainstormed words.
4. Compare the brainstormed words against the user's provided list to avoid repetition.
5. Select 25 words that meet all the criteria, ensuring no subtle connections exist.1. prickle
2. pylon
3. prowess
4. pumice
5. plinth
6. pollen
7. pantomime
8. parchment
9. pastry
10. pigment
11. pivot
12. porous
13. prelude
14. prism
15. propellant
16. pulley
17. pungent
