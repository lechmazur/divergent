words_742.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "t". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "t" words. I'll focus on common, everyday words that don't easily fall into specific themes or wordplay categories.

Plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "t" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the user's constraints (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Check for any obvious connections or shared categories between the remaining words.
4. Select 25 words that are sufficiently distinct and unrelated.
5. Number the words from 1 to 25.1. table
2. train
3. thumb
4. thread

6. tiger
7. time
8. toast
9. today
10. tooth
11. town
12. trip
13. truck
14. trust

20. type
