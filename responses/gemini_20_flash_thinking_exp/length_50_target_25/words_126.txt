words_126.txt
The user wants a list of 25 unique English words, each starting with "r", and unrelated to each other or the provided list of 50 words. I need to be careful to avoid any connections between the words, even subtle ones. I'll focus on selecting words from diverse semantic fields to minimize the chance of overlap.

Plan:
1. Generate a pool of "r" words.
2. Check each word against the provided list and the growing list of 25 to ensure no repetition.
3. Evaluate each potential word for any semantic connections to other words in the list.
4. Number the final 25 words.1. rabbit
