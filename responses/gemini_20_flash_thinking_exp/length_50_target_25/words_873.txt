The user wants a list of 25 unique English words, each starting with "i", and unrelated to each other or the provided list of 50 words. I need to be careful to avoid any proper nouns, specific identifiers, or words that share a category or connection.

Here's my plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "i" words.
2. Filter out any words that are proper nouns or specific identifiers based on the user's detailed instructions.
3. Check for any connections or shared categories between the brainstormed "i" words and the user's provided list.
4. Select 25 unique "i" words that have no apparent connection to each other or the provided list.
5. Number the selected words from 1 to 25.1. ignite
2. image
3. impact
4. imply
5. indoor
6. infant
7. inform
8. ingest
9. inhale
10. inland
11. insect
12. inside
13. insist
14. intact
15. intend
16. intern
17. invent
18. invest
19. invite
20. invoke
21. inward
22. iodine
23. irate
