The user wants a list of 25 English words, each starting with "e". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "e" words.

Here's a plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "e" words.
2. Filter out any words that are proper nouns or specific identifiers based on the user's criteria.
3. Check for any obvious connections or shared categories between the remaining "e" words and the user's list.
4. Select 25 "e" words that are as unrelated as possible to each other and the provided list.
5. Number the selected words from 1 to 25.1. each
