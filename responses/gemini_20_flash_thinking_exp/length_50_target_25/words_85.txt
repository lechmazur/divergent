words_85.txt
The user wants a list of 25 English words, each starting with "e". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "e" words. This includes avoiding wordplay connections. Each word needs to be numbered.

Here's my plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "e" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the proper noun/identifier rules.
3. Check for any connections or shared categories between the remaining "e" words and the user's list.
4. Select 25 "e" words that are sufficiently unrelated to each other and the user's list.
5. Number the selected words.1. each
