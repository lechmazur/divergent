Here's a plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "b" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the exclusion rules (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Check for any obvious connections or shared categories between the remaining "b" words.
4. Compare the "b" words against the provided list to ensure no repetitions.
5. Select 25 unrelated "b" words.
