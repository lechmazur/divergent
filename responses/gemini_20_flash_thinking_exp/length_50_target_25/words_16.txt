The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "i". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 provided words. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "i" words themselves. This includes avoiding wordplay connections. I will generate a list of "i" words and then carefully check for any semantic or wordplay relationships between them and against the provided list.1. ignite
