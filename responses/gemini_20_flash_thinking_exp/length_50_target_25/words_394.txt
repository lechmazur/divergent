The user wants a list of 25 English words, each starting with "e". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "e" words. I'll focus on concrete nouns, abstract nouns, verbs, and adjectives to ensure diversity and avoid thematic links.

Here's a possible plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "e" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the user's restrictions (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Check for any obvious connections or shared categories between the remaining "e" words and the user's list.
4. Select 25 diverse "e" words, ensuring no two share a category or connection.1. each
