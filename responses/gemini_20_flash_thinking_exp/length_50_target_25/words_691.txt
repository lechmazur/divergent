The user wants a list of 25 English words, each starting with "e". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "e" words. I'll focus on diverse, common nouns, verbs, and adjectives to minimize overlap.

Here's a possible strategy:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "e" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the exclusion rules.
3. Check for any obvious connections or shared categories between the remaining words.
4. Select 25 words that seem sufficiently unrelated.1. each
