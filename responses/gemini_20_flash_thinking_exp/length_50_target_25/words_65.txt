The user wants a list of 25 single, real English words, each starting with "c". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 provided words. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "c" words.

Here's my plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "c" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the restrictions (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Carefully select 25 words from the remaining pool, ensuring no obvious connections or shared categories exist between them or the provided words.
4. Number the selected words from 1 to 25.1. cabin
2. cable
3. cactus
4. cadence
5. cage
6. calamity
7. calcium
8. caliber
9. callous
10. calm
11. canal
12. candid
13. canine
14. canyon
15. capable
16. capacity
17. capital
18. capsule
19. capture
20. carbon
21. carcass
22. cardinal
23. cargo
24. carol
25. cart
