The user wants a list of 25 unique English words, each starting with "i", and unrelated to each other or the provided 50 words. I need to be careful to avoid any proper nouns, specific identifiers, or words that share a category or connection. I'll focus on common, everyday words to minimize the risk of overlap.

Here's a possible strategy:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "i" words.
2. Filter out any proper nouns or specific identifiers.
3. Check for any obvious connections or shared categories between the brainstormed words and the provided list.
4. Select 25 words that appear to be sufficiently unrelated.
5. Number the words from 1 to 25.1. ignite
2. image
3. index
4. infant
5. infer
6. ingot
7. inlet
8. inner
9. input
10. insect
11. insist
12. intact
13. intent
14. ivory
15. italic
16. item
17. itchy
18. ideal
19. idiom
20. idle
21. imply
22. immune
