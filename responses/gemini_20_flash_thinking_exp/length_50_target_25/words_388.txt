words_388.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single, real English words, each starting with 'v', 'x', 'z', 'j', or 'q'. These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the 25 words. I'll focus on selecting simple, common nouns and verbs to minimize the risk of overlap or categorization.

Plan:
1. Iterate through the allowed starting letters ('v', 'x', 'z', 'j', 'q').
2. For each letter, brainstorm common, unrelated words.
3. Check each potential word against the user's provided list and the growing list of 25 to ensure no repetition or connection.
4. Number the final 25 words.1. vacuum
