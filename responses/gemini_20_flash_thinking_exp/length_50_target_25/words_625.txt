words_625.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single, real English words, each starting with 'v', 'x', 'z', 'j', or 'q'. These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 provided words. No proper nouns or specific identifiers are allowed. No shared threads, connections, or category overlaps are permitted, including wordplay. The output should be a numbered list only.

Plan:
1. Iterate through possible words starting with 'v', 'x', 'z', 'j', or 'q'.
2. For each potential word, check if it's a real English word.
3. Check if the word is present in the provided list.
4. Check if the word violates any of the exclusion rules (proper nouns, specific identifiers).
5. Check for any shared threads, connections, or category overlaps with already selected words and the provided list.
6. If a word passes all checks, add it to the list.
7. Repeat until 25 words are collected.1. vacuum
