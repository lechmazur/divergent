words_910.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single, real English words, each starting with "g". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "g" words. I'll focus on concrete nouns, verbs, and adjectives to minimize overlap.

Here's a possible strategy:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "g" words.
2. Filter out any proper nouns or specific identifiers.
3. Check for any obvious connections or shared categories between the remaining words.
4. Compare the "g" words against the user's list to ensure no repetitions or strong thematic links.
5. Select 25 words that meet all the criteria.1. gable
