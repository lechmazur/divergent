words_860.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "s". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "s" words. I'll focus on common nouns and verbs, ensuring no obvious semantic or wordplay links.

Plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "s" words.
2. Filter out any words that might violate the restrictions.
3. Carefully select 25 words from the remaining pool, checking for any subtle connections or category overlaps.
4. Number the selected words from 1 to 25.1. scarf
2. siren
3. saddle
4. sprint
5. socket
6. sponge
7. stable
8. stump
9. sleeve
10. shadow
11. shovel
12. squint
13. stanza
14. sulfur
15. swivel
16. seldom
17. shatter
18. shimmer
19. slumber
20. snorkel
21. solace
22. spiral
23. sprout
24. squirm
25. stanza
