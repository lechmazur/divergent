words_693.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "g", and unrelated to each other or the 50 words they provided. I need to be careful to avoid any proper nouns, specific identifiers, or connections between the generated words. I will iterate through potential "g" words, checking against the provided list and the other generated words for any semantic or categorical overlap.

Plan:
1. Start with a broad set of "g" words.
2. For each potential word, check if it's in the provided list.
3. Check if it has any obvious connection to any word in the provided list.
4. Check if it has any obvious connection to any of the words already generated.
5. If it passes all checks, add it to the list.
6. Repeat until 25 words are collected.1. gable
