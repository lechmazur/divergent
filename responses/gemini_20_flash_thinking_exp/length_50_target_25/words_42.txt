words_42.txt
The user wants a list of 25 words, each starting with "m". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 provided words. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "m" words. I'll focus on common nouns and abstract concepts to minimize overlap.

Plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "m" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the restrictions.
3. Check for any connections or shared categories between the remaining words.
4. Select 25 unrelated words.1. meadow
2. magnet

10. mimic
