words_960.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "t". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 provided words. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "t" words. I'll focus on selecting diverse and common nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs to minimize connections.

Here's a possible strategy:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "t" words.
2. Filter out any words that are proper nouns or specific identifiers.
3. Check for any obvious connections or shared categories between the remaining words.
4. Select 25 words that are as unrelated as possible.
5. Number the selected words.1. table
