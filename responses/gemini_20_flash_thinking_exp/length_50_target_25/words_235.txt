The user wants a list of 25 English words, each starting with "e". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "e" words. I'll focus on concrete and abstract nouns, verbs, and adjectives to ensure diversity and lack of connection.

Here's a possible plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "e" words.
2. Filter out any words that might be related to the provided list or each other.
3. Ensure no proper nouns or specific identifiers are included.
4. Double-check for any subtle connections or shared categories.
