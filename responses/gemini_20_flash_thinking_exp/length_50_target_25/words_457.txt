The user wants a list of 25 unique English words, each starting with "i", and unrelated to each other or the provided 50 words. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and ensure no two words share a connection or fit into a specific category, including wordplay.

Here's my plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "i" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the restrictions (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Check for relationships or shared categories between the remaining words.
4. Select 25 words that are sufficiently distinct and unrelated.1. ignite
2. image
3. impact
4. index
5. infant
6. infer
7. inform
8. ingest
9. inhale
10. inhibit
11. inject
12. injure
13. inland
14. inner
15. input
16. insect
17. inside
18. insist
19. inspire
20. instant
21. intact
22. intend
23. intense
24. invent
25. ivory
