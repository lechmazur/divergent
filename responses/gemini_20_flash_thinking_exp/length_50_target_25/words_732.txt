The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "g". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "g" words.

Here's a possible approach:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "g" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the exclusion rules (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Check for relationships or connections between the remaining "g" words and the user's list.
4. Ensure no two "g" words share a category or obvious connection.
5. Select 25 suitable words and number them.1. gable
