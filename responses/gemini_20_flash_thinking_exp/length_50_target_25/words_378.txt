The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "i". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "i" words.

Here's my plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "i" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the restrictions (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Check for any obvious connections or shared categories between the remaining "i" words and the user's list.
4. Select 25 "i" words that are as unrelated as possible to each other and the provided list.
5. Number the selected words from 1 to 25.1. ignite
2. image
3. impact
4. imply
5. indoor
6. infer
7. ingot
8. inhale
9. inland
10. inner
11. input
12. insect
13. insist
14. intact
15. intend
16. inter
17. irony
18. issue
19. item
20. ivory
21. italic
22. itchy
23. idling
24. indigo
25. infant
