The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "b". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 provided words. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the new words.

Here's my plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "b" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the exclusion rules (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Check for any obvious connections or shared categories between the brainstormed words.
4. Compare the brainstormed words against the provided list to avoid duplicates or related terms.
5. Select 25 distinct and unrelated words.
6. Format the output as a numbered list.1. bellow
2. brittle
3. blunder
4. buoyant
5. bramble
6. badger
7. blemish
8. bolster
9. brawny
10. babble
11. balmy
12. barren
13. bastion
14. bewilder
15. bizarre
