The user wants a list of 25 unique English words, each starting with "w", and unrelated to each other or the 50 provided words. I need to ensure no proper nouns or specific identifiers are used. The words should also avoid any thematic or categorical connections, including wordplay.

Here's my plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "w" words.
2. Filter out any proper nouns or specific identifiers.
3. Check for any thematic or categorical connections between the brainstormed words.
4. Compare the brainstormed words against the provided list to ensure no duplicates.
5. Select 25 unique and unrelated words.
6. Format the output as a numbered list.1. wagon
2. waffle
3. walnut
4. wander
5. wanted
6. warden
7. warmth
8. warrant
9. wart
10. wary
11. waste
12. watch
