words_704.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single, real English words, each starting with 'v', 'x', 'z', 'j', or 'q'. These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 provided words. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the 25 words. I'll focus on selecting diverse words with distinct meanings and avoid any obvious thematic links.

Plan:
1. Iterate through the allowed starting letters ('v', 'x', 'z', 'j', 'q').
2. For each letter, brainstorm potential words.
3. Check each potential word against the provided list and the growing list of 25 to ensure no repetition.
4. Evaluate each potential word for any connections or shared categories with other words in the 25-word list.
5. Select 25 words that meet all criteria.
6. Format the output as a numbered list.1. vex
2. xylem
3. zealot
4. jigsaw
5. quiver
6. xenon
7. zipper
8. jaunty
9. quartz
10. vortex
11. xerophyte
12. zenith
