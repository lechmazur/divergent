The user wants a list of 25 unique English words, each starting with "y", and unrelated to each other or the provided 50 words. I need to be careful to avoid any proper nouns, specific identifiers, or connections between the "y" words themselves. I'll focus on common, everyday words to minimize the risk of overlap or categorization.

Here's a possible strategy:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "y" words.
2. Filter out any words that might violate the exclusion rules (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Check for any obvious connections or shared categories between the remaining "y" words.
4. Compare the "y" words against the provided list to ensure no repetitions.
5. Select the final 25 words, ensuring maximum unrelatedness.1. yacht
