words_368.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single, real English words, each starting with 'v', 'x', 'z', 'j', or 'q'. These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the 25 words. I'll focus on selecting words from different semantic fields to ensure no overlap.

Plan:
1. Iterate through the allowed starting letters ('v', 'x', 'z', 'j', 'q').
2. For each letter, brainstorm words, ensuring they are real English words and not on the provided list.
3. Check each potential word against the constraints: no proper nouns, specific identifiers, or connections to other selected words.
4. Keep track of the selected words to avoid repetition.
5. Number the final 25 words.1. vex
