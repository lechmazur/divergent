words_61.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "c". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "c" words. I'll focus on concrete and abstract nouns, verbs, and adjectives to ensure diversity and avoid thematic links.

Here's a possible plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "c" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the user's restrictions (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Check for any obvious connections or shared categories between the remaining words.
4. Select 25 words that are sufficiently distinct.1. cable
2. cabin
3. cactus
4. cage
5. calm
6. camel
7. campus
8. canal
9. candy
10. canon
11. canvas
12. canyon
13. capable
14. capital
15. captain
16. capture
17. carbon
18. career
19. cargo
20. carol
21. carpet
22. carrot
23. carton
24. carve
25. cascade
