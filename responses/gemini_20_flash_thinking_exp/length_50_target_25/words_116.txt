The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "e". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "e" words.

Here's my plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "e" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the user's restrictions (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Carefully select 25 words from the remaining pool, ensuring no obvious connections or shared categories exist between them or the provided list.
4. Number the selected words from 1 to 25.1. each
2. earth
3. elbow
4. elder
5. elect
6. empty
7. enact
8. endow
9. enemy
10. enjoy
11. enter
12. epoch
13. equal
14. erupt
15. essay
16. evade
17. event
18. every
19. exact
20. exert
21. exile
22. exist
23. extra
24. eaves
25. erode
