words_229.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single, real English words, each starting with 'v', 'x', 'z', 'j', or 'q'. These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the 25 words. I'll focus on selecting words from different semantic fields to ensure no overlap.

Plan:
1. Iterate through the allowed starting letters ('v', 'x', 'z', 'j', 'q').
2. For each letter, brainstorm words, ensuring they are real English words and not on the provided list.
3. As I select words, I'll check for any potential connections or shared categories with previously selected words and the user's list.
4. Number each selected word.
5. Continue until I have 25 unique and unrelated words.1. vacuum
