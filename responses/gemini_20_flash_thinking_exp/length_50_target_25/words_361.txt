The user wants a list of 25 unique English words starting with "n", with no connections or shared categories between any two words in the list. I also need to avoid any proper nouns or specific identifiers as outlined in the instructions. I will need to be careful to ensure no two words have any obvious or subtle relationship.

Here's a possible approach:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "n" words.
2. Filter out any proper nouns or specific identifiers.
3. Evaluate the remaining words for potential connections or shared categories.
4. Select 25 words that appear to be completely unrelated.1. nabob
2. nadir
3. nag
4. nail
5. nape
6. narrate
7. nasal
8. nasty
9. natal
10. nation
11. native
12. nature
