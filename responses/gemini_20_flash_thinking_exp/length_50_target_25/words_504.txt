words_504.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single, real English words, each starting with "t". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "t" words. I'll focus on concrete nouns, abstract nouns, verbs, and adjectives to ensure diversity and lack of connection.

Here's a possible plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "t" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the restrictions (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Check for any obvious connections or shared categories between the remaining words.
4. Select 25 words that are sufficiently unrelated.1. table
2. train
3. thought
4. thumb
5. time
6. taste
7. town
8. tree
9. truth
10. task
11. team
