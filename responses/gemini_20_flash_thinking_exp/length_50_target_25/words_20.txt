words_20.txt
The user wants a list of 25 unique English words, each starting with "k", and unrelated to each other or the 50 provided words. I need to ensure no proper nouns or specific identifiers are used. The words should also not share any conceptual connections or fit into the same category, including wordplay connections. I will go through each potential "k" word and check against the provided list and the other generated "k" words for any overlap in meaning, category, or wordplay.

Plan:
1. Brainstorm a list of "k" words.
2. Check each word against the provided list.
3. Check each word against the other generated "k" words for connections.
4. Ensure no proper nouns or specific identifiers are used.
