The user wants a list of 25 English words, each starting with "e". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "e" words.

Here's a possible approach:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "e" words.
