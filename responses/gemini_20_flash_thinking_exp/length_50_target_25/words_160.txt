words_160.txt
The user wants a list of 25 unique English words starting with the letter "k". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "k" words.

Here's my plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "k" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the user's restrictions (proper nouns, specific identifiers).
3. Check for any obvious connections or shared categories between the remaining "k" words.
4. Compare the "k" words against the provided list of 50 words to ensure no repetitions.
5. Select 25 unique and unrelated "k" words.
6. Format the output as a numbered list.1. kale
2. kayak
3. keel
4. ken
5. kept
6. kerf
7. kern
8. ketch
9. keyhole
10. khaki
11. kibble
12. kickstand
13. killjoy
14. kiln
15. kilt
16. kimono
17. kinship
18. kiosk
19. kismet
20. kith
21. knave
22. knead
23. knoll
24. kudos
25. krypton
