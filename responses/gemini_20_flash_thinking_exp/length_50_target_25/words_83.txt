The user wants a list of 25 English words, each starting with "e". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to be careful to avoid any proper nouns, specific identifiers, or connections between the words, even through wordplay or shared categories.

Here's my plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "e" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the user's restrictions (proper nouns, connections to provided words, etc.).
3. Carefully select 25 words from the remaining pool, ensuring no connections or shared categories exist between them.
4. Number the selected words from 1 to 25.1. each
2. earth
3. elbow
4. empty
5. enter
6. equal
7. erode
8. erupt
9. evade
10. event
11. exact
12. excel
13. exert
14. extra
15. eaves

17. echo
18. eclat
19. edge
20. edict
21. eerie
22. eight
23. eject
