words_70.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "p". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "p" words.

Here's a possible approach:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "p" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the restrictions (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Check for any obvious connections or shared categories between the remaining words.
4. Select 25 words that appear sufficiently unrelated.1. purple
2. puzzle
3. planet
4. pencil
5. pillow
6. pepper
7. pocket
8. promise
9. prince
10. parade
11. pirate
12. powder
13. pebble
14. phantom
15. picture
16. pigeon
