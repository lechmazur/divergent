words_285.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single, real English words, each starting with "r". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 provided words. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "r" words. I'll focus on diverse, common nouns and verbs to minimize overlap.

Plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "r" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the restrictions (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Check for any connections or shared categories between the remaining "r" words and the provided list.
4. Select 25 unrelated "r" words.
5. Number the words 1-25.1. rabbit
2. radio
3. raft
4. rage
5. rail
6. rain
7. raise
8. rake
9. rally
10. ranch
11. range
12. rank
13. rapid
14. rare
15. rash
16. rat
17. rate
18. ratio
19. raven
20. raw
21. rayon
22. razor
23. reach
24. react
