The user wants a list of 25 unique English words, each starting with "i", and unrelated to each other or the provided list of 50 words. I need to ensure no proper nouns or specific identifiers are used. The words should also not share any obvious connections or fit into the same category, including wordplay connections.

Here's my plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "i" words.
2. Filter out any words that are proper nouns or specific identifiers based on the user's criteria.
3. Check for any obvious relationships or shared categories between the brainstormed words.
4. Compare the brainstormed words against the user's provided list to ensure no duplicates.
5. Select 25 words that meet all the criteria.
6. Format the output as a numbered list.1. ignite
2. image
3. impact
4. import
5. inside
6. invent
7. island
8. item
9. ivory
10. italic
11. infant
12. indigo
13. index
14. inform
15. injure
16. insect
17. insist
18. intact
19. intend
20. invite
21. iodine
22. irate
23. iris
