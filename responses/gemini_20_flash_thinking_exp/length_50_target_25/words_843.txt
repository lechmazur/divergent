words_843.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single, real English words, each starting with 'v', 'x', 'z', 'j', or 'q'. These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 provided words. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the 25 words. I'll focus on selecting simple, common nouns and verbs to minimize the risk of overlap or categorization.

Plan:
1. Iterate through the allowed starting letters ('v', 'x', 'z', 'j', 'q').
2. For each letter, brainstorm common, unrelated words.
3. Check each potential word against the 50 provided words and previously selected words to ensure no repetition.
4. Verify that the potential word doesn't violate the restrictions on proper nouns, identifiers, or shared categories.
5. Number the final 25 words.1. vacuum
