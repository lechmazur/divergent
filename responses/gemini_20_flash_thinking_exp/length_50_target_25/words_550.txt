words_550.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single, real English words, each starting with "c". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 provided words. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "c" words. I will go through the alphabet and think of "c" words, checking against the provided list and the other "c" words I've generated to ensure no connections.
