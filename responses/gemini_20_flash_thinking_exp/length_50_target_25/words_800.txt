words_800.txt
The user wants a list of 25 single English words, each starting with "s". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "s" words. I'll focus on selecting diverse and common "s" words that don't easily fall into obvious groupings.

Plan:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "s" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the restrictions (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Check for any obvious connections or shared categories between the remaining words.
4. Select 25 words that are sufficiently distinct.
5. Number the words 1-25.1. scarf
2. siren
3. sloth
4. sprint
5. solder
6. sprout
7. strait
8. saddle
9. scythe
10. smudge
11. swivel
12. stanza
13. septum
14. shingle
15. skillet
16. solace
17. supple
18. suture
19. swerve
20. scampi
21. sieve
22. squall
23. stylus
24. stanza
25. scion
