The user wants a list of 25 single, real English words, each starting with "c". These words must be unrelated to each other and the 50 words they provided. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "c" words. I'll focus on diverse, concrete nouns, abstract nouns, verbs, and adjectives to ensure no obvious connections.

Here's a possible strategy:
1. Generate a larger pool of "c" words.
2. Filter out any proper nouns or specific identifiers.
