The user wants a list of 25 unique English words, each starting with "e", and unrelated to each other or the provided list of 50 words. I need to avoid proper nouns, specific identifiers, and any connections or shared categories between the "e" words themselves.

Here's my plan:
1. **Brainstorm "e" words:** I'll start by generating a large pool of words beginning with "e".
2. **Filter for uniqueness:** I'll compare each generated "e" word against the user's list and my own growing list to ensure no repetitions.
3. **Check for forbidden categories:** I'll carefully review each potential "e" word against the user's restrictions on proper nouns and specific identifiers.
4. **Ensure unrelatedness:** This is the trickiest part. I'll consider potential connections between the "e" words, including semantic relationships, shared contexts, or even wordplay. I'll aim for a diverse set of words with minimal overlap in meaning or usage.
5. **Number the list:** Once I have 25 suitable words, I'll number them from 1 to 25.1. each
