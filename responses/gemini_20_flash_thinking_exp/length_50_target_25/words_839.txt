Here's a possible approach:
1. Brainstorm a large pool of "p" words.
2. Filter out any words that violate the exclusion rules (proper nouns, etc.).
3. Check for any obvious connections or shared categories between the remaining "p" words.
4. Compare the "p" words against the provided list of 50 words to ensure no overlap.
